# PythonToUnity Integration

Provides ability to use python scripts in unity. 

## PythonBehaviour
PythonBehaviour can be used as an alternative to C# MonoBehavoiur. They can be used to make your game moddable, make maps more interactive, easily customize builded game, make small handy development scripts, do fast prototypes and more.

## PythonConsole
PythonConsole is drag-and-drop prefab which can make your development much easier. It can do basically anything C# scripts can do. Call any public methods on any objects, evaluate expressions, create and destroy objects, anything! And all this can be done even in build.
Use it to debug your game when needed, test features without need to create ui elements for every single one or as a cheat code for any action you want.

## Things still need to be done
- use classes for behaviour .py scripts
- autocompletion for console
- import all assemblies by default in console
- security stuff for both console and behaviour
